# Pokedex
Welcome to the React Pokedex Web Application! This application allows you to explore a comprehensive list of Pokémon and view detailed information about each one. It uses the public [Poké API](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch data and is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access. This system was implemented as a WEB2Y assignment for educational purposes, as such it is incomplete and may need future updates.

## About
A Pokédex is a fictional electronic device in the Pokémon universe. The primary function of a Pokédex is to serve as an encyclopedia or database of information about the various species of Pokémon. Trainers use the Pokédex to record information about Pokémon they encounter and capture during their adventures. This project implements the idea of the pokedex that can accessed through a website by everyone.
